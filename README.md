IntelliJ plugin for dealing with OpenSCAD

OpenSCAD is an open source, script based CAD program. This IntelliJ plugin supports the editing of the OpenSCAD scripts.

This plugin is really at the beginning of development. The status is:
* .scad files are recognized
* Grammar for .sdac files is working. I am sure there are bugs in it but the grammar works with some of my input files.
